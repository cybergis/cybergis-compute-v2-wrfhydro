    "This notebook demonstrates how to prepare a WRFHydro model on CyberGIS-Jupyter for Water (CJW) for execution on a supported High-Performance Computing (HPC) resource via the CyberGIS-Compute service. First-time users are highly encouraged to go through the [NCAR WRFHydro Hands-on Training on CJW](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/d2c6618090f34ee898e005969b99cf90/) to get familiar WRFHydro model basics including compilation of source code, preparation of forcing data and typical model configurations. This notebook will not cover those topics and assume users already have hands-on experience with local model runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "CyberGIS-Compute is a CyberGIS-enabled web service sits between CJW and HPC resources. It acts as a middleman that takes user requests (eg. submission of a model) originated from CJW, carries out the actual job submission of model on the target HPC resource, monitors job status, and retrieves outputs when the model execution has completed. The functionality of CyberGIS-Compute is exposed as a series of REST APIs. A Python client, [CyberGIS-Compute SDK](https://github.com/cybergis/cybergis-compute-python-sdk), has been developed for use in the CJW environment that provides a simple GUI to guide users through the job submission process. Prior to job submission, model configuration and input data should be prepared and arranged in a certain way that meets specific requirements, which vary by models and their implementation in CyberGIS-Compute. We will walk through the requirements for WRFHydro below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general workflow for WRFHydro in CyberGIS-Compute works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User picks a Model_Version of WRFHydro to use;\n",
    "2. User prepares configuration files and data for the model on CJW;\n",
    "3. User submits configuration files and data to CyberGIS-Compute;\n",
    "4. CyberGIS-Compute transfers configuration files and data to target HPC;\n",
    "5. CyberGIS-Compute downloads the chosen Model_Version of WRFhydro codebase on HPC;\n",
    "6. CyberGIS-Compute applies compile-time configuration files to the codebase, and compiles the source code on the fly;\n",
    "7. CyberGIS-Compute applies run-time configuration files and data to the model;\n",
    "8. CyberGIS-Compute submits the model job to HPC scheduler for model execution;\n",
    "9. CyberGIS-Compute monitors job status;\n",
    "10. CyberGIS-Compute transfers model outputs from HPC to CJW upon user request;\n",
    "11. User performs post-processing work on CJW;\n",
    "\n",
    "Current implementation for WRFHydro in CyberGIS-Compute is compatible with WRFHydro 5.x official releases hosted on the NCAR github repo (https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm_public). It requires users to provide configurations & data in 3 categories: **compile-time configuration, run-time configuration, and model data**. The following table lists details for each category. **For more in-depth description on each configuration and data file, please refer to the official [WRFHydro Technical Documention](https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro/technical-description-user-guide) at NCAR**.\n",

    "As listed above, the items marked as \"GUI or API\" under \"Submission\" should be provided to the job submission GUI, and the ones marked as \"Upload_Foler\" should be put in a local folder that will be submitted to HPC through the CyberGIS-Compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since WRFHydro codebase has been under active development, \"mix-matching\" configuration files or data that are made for different WRFHydro versions may cause model failure and/or tricky issues. For example, the file 'namelist.hrldas' from Version_A may not work with WRFHydro Version_B, or some domain files worked with WRFHydro 5.0 may not work with WRFHydro 5.2. **<span style=\"color: red\"> User should make sure the configuration files and data provided are compatible with the chosen Model_Version of WRFHydro codebase.</span>** An quick way to check the compatibility  would be try out a small-scale local run on CJW. Please refer to [NCAR WRFHydro Hands-on Training on CJW](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/d2c6618090f34ee898e005969b99cf90/) for examples.  We highly recommend the \"test small first\" approach before submitting  any job to HPC using CyberGIS-Compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we will use the testcase (Croton, NY) shipped with [WRFHydro v5.2.0](https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm_public/releases/tag/v5.2.0) official release (Dec, 2021), which guarantees the compatibility between model codebase and data/parameters. Here is a [resource on HydroShare](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/f2632892a18a4aafaa5b540db6403046/) that serves as a backup source in case the github release gets changed or removed in the future (possible but unlikely).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"statics/release_v520.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "FYI: The support for WRFHydro model in CyberGIS-Compute is added through the \"community contribution\" approach (introduced in CyberGIS-Compute V2), and the implementation can be accessible at https://github.com/cybergis/cybergis-compute-v2-wrfhydro. This work is based on a close collaboration between [CyberGIS Center](https://cybergis.illinois.edu/) at UIUC and [Dr. Ayman Nassar](https://uwrl.usu.edu/people/research-staff/nassar-ayman) at Utah Water Research Laboratory, USU under the [HydroShare](https://www.hydroshare.org/) project."
